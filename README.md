# `simple_window` - Simple cross-platform windowing library.

simple_window is a simple, lightweight, cross-platform library to create and query windows.

> **_NOTE:_** The library currently only supports windows. I'm mainly using this library for my game engine. I'll eventually implement windowing for GNU/Linux somewhere in the future.

## Support
This library is intended to support only Windows & GNU/Linux. I have no intenion whatsoever of adding support for MacOS, but I am open to pull requests.

## Documentation
Please visit the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/simple-window/latest) page for documentation.
